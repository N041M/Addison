# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repository. Read the two specs before non-trivial
work — this file is the short version, they are authoritative:

- `docs/addison-design-doc.md` — product/UX rationale (the *why*)
- `docs/addison-engineering-spec.md` — build brief; **architecture is final for v1**

## What this is

Addison is a local-first desktop chat agent that is **approachable by default and
powerful on request**. Its default audience is non-technical users (personas
"Mira", 54, and "Petr", 68 — design-doc §5); technical users/developers are served
by an opt-in **Developer profile** (design-doc §7.11), not by complicating the
default. A profile reshapes the *surface and default capabilities* only — it
**never** changes the security model (see invariants below). Simple is the default;
Developer is opt-in. When adding a capability, ask which profile surfaces it — do
not leak developer affordances into Simple.

Three processes, three trust levels (spec §1.3):

- **`shell/`** — Tauri 2.x (Rust). Highest trust: OS keychain, file picker,
  updater. Supervises the Agent Core; relays IPC. Never runs model instructions.
- **`agent_core/`** — Python 3.12. Orchestration loop, tool registry, permission
  gate, routines, SQLite. No OS permissions of its own — every filesystem/OS
  effect goes back through the shell via IPC.
- **`shell/src/`** — React + TS frontend. Lowest trust: renders state, never sees
  API keys, never touches the network directly.

Shell ↔ Core talk over **JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio**.

## Non-negotiable safety invariants (spec §8)

These are hard constraints. If a request appears to conflict with one, **flag it
rather than working around it silently.**

1. **No arbitrary code/shell execution — ever.** Tools are individual typed
   functions, not "run command". Routines are *declarative plans* (§6.1), not
   scripts. Do not add `eval`, a Lua sandbox, or a raw-code field to a Routine.
2. **Every `risk_tier != LOW` tool must have a real `undo()`**, enforced at
   registration in `tools/registry.py` (it raises otherwise). Do NOT satisfy this
   with a no-op `undo()` — a tool that genuinely can't be undone stays LOW and
   read-only. This registration check is the single most important test in the
   codebase (spec §9).
3. **API keys never reach the frontend/webview.** They live in the OS keychain,
   read by the Rust shell / Agent Core only at the moment of use, never persisted
   in Agent Core memory beyond one request, never in SQLite.
4. The Setup Assistant relay's keys never exist in this repo's runtime — they're
   external and server-side.
5. **A Routine never gets permissions beyond what the user granted live** — no
   privilege escalation via automation. It uses the *same* `ToolRegistry` and
   `PermissionGate` instances as the live orchestrator.
6. **No scheduling / autonomous triggering in v1** (§6.7).
7. **Widgets are declarative specs (routine-run or whitelisted stat display) —
   never code; enforced at save and render.** A widget is one of exactly two
   fixed shapes (`agent_core/widgets.py`): `{kind: "routine", routineId, title}`
   runs a saved routine through the *existing* routine.run path (same registry +
   gate, zero new execution surface), or `{kind: "stat", source, title}` displays
   a value from a fixed whitelist (`tokens_month`, `provider_latency`,
   `connections`). No eval, expression, or template field exists; unknown
   kinds/sources are rejected at save and hidden at render.

## Module boundary rule (spec §2)

`agent_core/tools/`, `agent_core/providers/`, and `agent_core/routines/` **must
not import from each other**. They are all consumed by `orchestrator.py`, the
only module allowed to know about all three. This is what lets the Routine engine
replay tool calls through the exact same registry + gate as the live loop.

## Conventions

- **Python**: 3.12, stdlib-first. SQLite via `sqlite3`/SQLAlchemy Core, no heavy
  ORM. `httpx` for HTTPS. Ruff, line length 100. Dataclasses mirror the SQL
  schema 1:1.
- **Provider-agnostic orchestrator**: never branch on the concrete provider with
  `isinstance`. Handle capability differences via `ProviderCapabilities`.
- **Per-request model routing**: the orchestrator calls `model_router.resolve()`
  each turn — there is no single `self.active_provider`. Multiple roles
  (PRIMARY, LOCAL) can be configured and reachable at once (spec §4.1.1).
- **Plain language, no jargon** in any user-facing string (tool labels,
  permission cards, errors). No stack traces reach the user — errors become a
  plain message + one suggested next step.
- **UI (step 7+): distinct, non-AI look — "Fern" direction (v3, amended
  2026-07)** (design-doc §7.1). Never the generic AI-chat aesthetic (purple
  gradients, glassmorphism, sparkle/bot icons, shimmer) and never a model
  vendor's branding (no cream/terracotta, no steel blue). The direction is a
  **warm, calm "correspondence" look**: warm paper neutrals + one **fern-green**
  accent (Addison's voice, primary actions, live state — never decoration), the
  message body in a **serif** (Source Serif 4) beside a plain **Public Sans** UI
  and **IBM Plex Mono** for machine facts only. One honest **shape rule** —
  **blocky things are live annotations** (square edges, 2px left rules, small-caps
  labels: "Addison's work", section labels, active sidebar item) and **rounded
  things are yours to own/act on** (6px small buttons · 8px inputs/rows · 10px
  cards/composer · 12px banners · 999px pills). **Light by default with a
  class-driven dark mode** (`darkMode:"class"`, persisted as `addison.theme`);
  type stays compact-but-legible for older readers (personas 54 and 68). Fonts
  are the **one exception to "system stacks only"**: the three families are
  **bundled as OFL woff2** in `shell/src/assets/fonts/` with `@font-face` —
  CSP-safe because bundled, never hotlinked (strict `default-src 'self'`), always
  with system fallbacks. **`docs/design-brief-fern` is authoritative** for tokens,
  type, shape, and copy; the tokens in **shell/tailwind.config.js** implement it.
  This **supersedes the earlier dark terminal-adjacent look** (which superseded
  design-doc §7.1's cool-slate palette); §7.1's layout/IA and accessibility rules
  are unchanged.
- **IPC types are hand-synced**: keep `agent_core/protocol.py` and
  `shell/src/types/protocol.ts` in lockstep (codegen is Phase 3, not v1).

## Build order (spec §11 — build in sequence, each independently testable)

Done: (1) schema + dataclasses, (2) `ToolRegistry` + undo check + calculator,
(3) `PermissionGate`. Also shipped past the numbered sequence: the Fern UI
redesign, and the **widget rail** — declarative routine/stat widgets
(`agent_core/widgets.py`, invariant 7) plus the `usage_log` token/latency
substrate (§4.8) that feeds the token meter + connections cards.

Next: (4) `AnthropicProvider` + minimal `ModelRouter` + orchestration loop,
**CLI-only** — get a working chat-with-tools loop before touching the shell.
Then (5) remaining tools + their `undo()`, (6) `UndoManager`, (7) Tauri shell +
IPC, (8) Routines, (9) Setup Assistant relay, (10) Ollama + full router, (11)
Profiles — formalize the Simple/Developer split (`profiles.py` exists as scaffold;
it parameterizes registration/onboarding, never the permission gate — spec §4.7,
§8.7).

Most files past step 3 are stubs marked `TODO(step N)` pointing at the spec
section — implement them in order, not opportunistically.

## Multi-provider (owner decision 2026-07-18 — overrides spec §10 "Anthropic only")

OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and an OpenAI-compatible **custom server** are now v1,
alongside Anthropic. Keys are stored per **provider id** (`anthropic | openai |
google | custom`) in the OS keychain (Rust `store_provider_key`/`delete_provider_key`,
account = `provider-key:{provider}`; the legacy `provider-key:primary` Anthropic
entry auto-migrates on first read). The core reads a key via
`keychain.getProviderKey {provider}` at the moment of use only — keys never reach
the webview or SQLite (`provider.list`/`connect` responses carry status/metadata
ONLY). `provider.connect` validates with one tiny request (Anthropic: `GET /v1/models`;
OpenAI/custom: `GET {base}/v1/models`; Google: `GET /v1beta/models`), then folds the
provider's models into the single picker union. Non-secret connection metadata lives
in the `provider_config` table; the custom base URL is the ONE permitted `http://`
case (validated http(s)://). The orchestrator stays provider-agnostic — capability
differences via `ProviderCapabilities`, never `isinstance`.

## Do NOT build yet (spec §10)

Automatic
task-based model routing/auto-switching (**planned for v2** — v1 ships the
substrate: `vision`/`audio` capability flags and multiple local models with an
*explicit* picker, but the automatic choice among them is v2), the Context
Budget Manager / automatic long-conversation continuation (**planned for v2**
— spec §4.8; v1 ships only the schema substrate at step 6, and it is
orchestrator machinery, never a registry tool), messaging channels, Routine
step-editing UI, any Routine scheduling/triggers, a Rust rewrite of the Agent
Core, and the two v2 items adopted from the 2026-07 ecosystem survey —
Routine export/import sharing and untrusted-content screening (design-doc
§11 "Adopted from the 2026-07 ecosystem survey") — do not pull them forward.
